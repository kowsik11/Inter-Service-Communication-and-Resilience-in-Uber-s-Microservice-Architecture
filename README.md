## 📝 Project Description

**Uber's backend infrastructure** is powered by **microservices**, where thousands of services communicate in real-time to handle ride requests, payments, driver dispatch, and customer support. In this project, we analyze:
- **How microservices in Uber communicate** using **synchronous and asynchronous messaging**.
- **Resilience techniques** such as **circuit breakers, retries, timeouts, and failover strategies**.
- **How Uber handles high traffic loads** using **load balancing and distributed queues**.
- **Fault tolerance mechanisms** to prevent cascading failures in the system.

This project provides insights into building **fault-tolerant, scalable, and highly available microservice architectures**.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Inter-Service Communication:** Covers **gRPC, REST APIs, and event-driven messaging**.
- **Resilience Mechanisms:** Implements **circuit breakers, retries, and fallback strategies**.
- **Load Balancing:** Uses **service discovery and dynamic routing** for efficient load distribution.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Explores **Kafka and messaging queues** for asynchronous processing.
- **Failure Handling:** Implements **timeout mechanisms and distributed tracing** for fault diagnosis.
- **Scalability Considerations:** Discusses **containerization and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)**.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Java
- **Microservices Frameworks:** Flask, Spring Boot
- **Communication Protocols:** REST, gRPC, WebSockets
- **Messaging Queues:** Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ
- **Resilience Library:** Netflix Hystrix (Circuit Breaker)
- **API Gateway:** Kong, NGINX
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Uber's architecture consists of multiple independent services working together. The key components include:
1. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services.
2. **Service Discovery**: Enables dynamic registration and lookup of microservices.
3. **Communication Layer**: Uses REST/gRPC for direct communication and Kafka for event-driven messaging.
4. **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple instances.
5. **Resilience Mechanisms**: Implements retries, circuit breakers, and failover strategies.
6. **Monitoring & Logging**: Uses distributed tracing to diagnose failures in the system.

## 🔄 Inter-Service Communication

Uber relies on different communication strategies based on service needs:

### 🔹 **Synchronous Communication**
- **gRPC**: Used for high-performance, low-latency communication.
- **REST APIs**: Used when interoperability is required.

### 🔹 **Asynchronous Communication**
- **Kafka & RabbitMQ**: Used for event-driven processing (e.g., ride-matching, surge pricing).
- **WebSockets**: Used for real-time updates (e.g., ride status updates for users).

## 🛡️ Resilience Strategies

To prevent failures from cascading across services, Uber implements:

### 🔥 **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Prevents repeated failures by **disabling a failing service temporarily**.
- Implemented using **Netflix Hystrix**.

### 🔄 **Retries & Timeouts**
- **Retries**: Automatically retries failed requests within a limit.
- **Timeouts**: Prevents waiting indefinitely for a failed service.

### 🌍 **Load Balancing**
- Uses **service discovery** (e.g., Consul, Kubernetes) for intelligent request routing.
- Ensures that traffic is **evenly distributed** across microservices.

### 🔁 **Failover & Redundancy**
- Services are **replicated** across multiple regions.
- **Fallback mechanisms** ensure that alternative services handle requests during failures.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 📥 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker & Kubernetes
- Python or Java (depending on implementation)
- Kafka & Rabbi
